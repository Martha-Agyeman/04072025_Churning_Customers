# 04072025_Churning_Customers

Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for large companies. Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer churn. Therefore, finding factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. 

The model below is a multi-layer processing model that, when deployed, can take user input and return a categorical value for the user, showing whether there is a customer churn or not.


This repository contains the .py and .ipynb files for the implemented models, with detailed descriptions of the code sells and how the implementation was done. 
The CustomerChurnDeployment.py file contains the streamlit implementation for the model deployment. It accepts the user input, encodes and runs it through the deployed model
The Model.H5 file contains the saved model which is then loaded and deployed in the python file described above.
Aditionally, a deplyment video of the model, showing how the deployed app works
